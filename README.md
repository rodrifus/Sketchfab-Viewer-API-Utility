Sketchfab API Utility Tutorial

If you plan to use the Sketchfab Viewer API on your websites I have created a utility that abstracts much of the coding required to do things like initialization, changing colors, toggling object visibility and loading textures. There are also detailed logs to the console when an error is made such as referencing materials, material channels or scene objects that do not exist.
